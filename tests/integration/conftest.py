    Deprecated: do not use this fixture for new tests, unless for very
    specific use cases. Use `isolated_app` instead.

    Flask application with demosite data and without any database isolation:
    any db transaction performed during the tests are persisted into the db.

    Creates a Flask application with a simple testing configuration,
    then creates an application context and inside of it recreates
    all databases and indices from the fixtures. Finally it yields,
    so that all tests that explicitly use the ``app`` fixture have
    access to an application context.
